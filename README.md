# Event-Driven Architecture in the Cloud

![Event-Driven Architecture in the Cloud](https://chadgreen.blob.core.windows.net/slides/Event%20Driven%20Architecture%20in%20the%20Cloud.jpg)

## Abstract
Event-driven architectures is a versatile approach to designing and integrating complex software systems with loosely coupled components.  While not a new concept, event-driven architecture is seeing a new life as applications move to cloud as it provides much more robust possibilities to solve business problems of today and in the future.  In this session, you will learn how to create a loosely coupled architecture for your business that has the domain at the core.  You will learn the basics of event-driven architecture, how to transform your complex systems to become event driven, and what benefits this architecture brings to your businesses.  The overall architecture is applicable to any cloud stack, but this session will have examples using Azure offerings.

## Short Abstract
Event-driven architectures is a versatile approach to designing and integrating complex software systems with loosely coupled components.  In this session, you will learn how to create a loosely coupled architecture for your business that has the domain at the core.

## Elevator Pitch
Learn how to create a loosely coupled architecture for your business that has the domain at the core.

## Why You Should Attend Session
Over the last couple of years, microservices has been the answer to how to solve all your problems.  The primary goal of microservices is to break up a system into independent services focused on a particular business area.  But many times, we still see dependency between these “independent” services which causes numerous issues.  Event-driven architecture goes several steps further in order to truly get decoupled, encapsulated services which are highly responsive, scalable/distributed, and independent. In this session, you will learn about event-driven architecture and how to implement it within the Microsoft Azure stack.
